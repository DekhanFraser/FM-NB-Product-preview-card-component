## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first project that I made after learning the basics of HTML and CSS. I used some guidance from online documentation and YouTube videos for tips and tricks on good practices. 

My biggest lessons here are the following:
- CSS reset
- BEM naming convention
- CSS variables
- rem / em relative sizing

I tried to get the design as close as possible to the original while still using relative sizing instead of pixel perfect alignments.

### Continued development

Since this was my first project, I used online guidance from videos and advice from my developer friends. My focus for the next projects will be to implement as much as possible without asking for help.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me wrap m head around using CSS resets.
